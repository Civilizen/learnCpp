# ZOJ1383

## Binary Numbers
Example

The positions of 1's in the binary representation of 13 are 0, 2, 3.


Task

Write a program which for each data set:

reads a positive integer n,

computes the positions of 1's in the binary representation of n,

writes the result.


Input

The first line of the input contains exactly one positive integer d equal to the number of data sets, 1 <= d <= 10. The data sets follow.

Each data set consists of exactly one line containing exactly one integer n, 1 <= n <= 10^6.


Output

The output should consists of exactly d lines, one line for each data set.

Line i, 1 <= i <= d, should contain increasing sequence of integers separated by single spaces - the positions of 1's in the binary representation of the i-th input number.


Sample Input

1
13


Sample Output

0 2 3
